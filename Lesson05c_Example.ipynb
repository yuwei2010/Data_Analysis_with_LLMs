       "- Data source preference for MVP:\n",
       "  - A) Synthetic dataset created in-memory with a couple of fields (time, value, category)\n",
       "  - B) Small public dataset (e.g., a tiny CSV) with a few categories\n",
       "  - C) Placeholder to connect to a real data source later\n",
       "- Chart types priority (choose 2–3 to lock MVP):\n",
       "  - Line/time-series, Bar, Scatter (default trio)\n",
       "- Deployment target:\n",
       "  - Local Dockerized dev environment first; production deployment can be cloud (AWS/GCP) later\n",
       "  - If cloud now, do you prefer a simple container registry + managed service, or fully managed serverless?\n",
       "\n",
       "7) Next steps (actions I’ll take once you confirm)\n",
       "- Draft the task_plan.md, findings.md, and progress.md templates tailored to our choices\n",
       "- Outline the MVP acceptance criteria and a concrete 2–4 week sprint plan\n",
       "- Prepare a minimal contract for the data source, chart types, and deployment decisions to capture in the plan\n",
       "- Set up a lightweight risk register and a communication cadence\n",
       "\n",
       "If you confirm the data source option, chart priorities, and deployment target, I’ll finalize the planning artifacts and kick off the first sprint with concrete tasks and milestones. Also, I can start populating the planning files in the project directory (task_plan.md, findings.md, progress.md) to keep everything synchronized and auditable.'\n",

       "- Scaffold a FastAPI skeleton: endpoints GET /data, GET /viz, POST /visualize; Pydantic models; in-memory data.\n",
       "- Add a tiny frontend page using Plotly.js to fetch /data and render the first chart.\n",
       "\n",
       "I can also implement a minimal synthetic data generator to kick off /data with deterministic data.\n",

       "- Define sprint structure and acceptance criteria:\n",
       "  - Sprint 1 (approx. 2 weeks): End-to-end demo path for /data, /viz, and /visualize with a basic frontend; all core endpoints implemented; deterministic synthetic data; basic tests in place; Dockerized dev environment.\n",
       "  - Performance target: /data and /viz responses under a reasonable threshold for small datasets (we’ll tighten this with baseline measurements later).\n",

       "- Roles and ownership (proposed starter):\n",
