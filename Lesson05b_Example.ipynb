      "    \u001b[94mReasoning: \u001b[0m\u001b[90mOkay, let's tackle this user query step by step.\n",
      "    The user wants me to use the \"planning-with-files\" guidance to plan a web\n",
      "    search for sport news from Stuttgart of the current month and return at\n",
      "    least 5 news items. Then, perform the task using \"web-search\" and write the\n",
      "    results to a file called \"stuttgart_sport_news.md\".  First, I need to check\n",
      "    if the instructions provided in the XML tags relate to this task. The user\n",
      "    mentioned both \"planning-with-files\" and \"web-search\", which are listed in\n",
      "    the INSTRUCTIONS. So, according to the initial guidelines, I should first\n",
      "    use the \"read_skill_instruction\" tool to read the details for these skills.\n",
      "    Starting with \"planning-with-files\": calling read_skill_instruction with\n",
      "    skill_name \"planning-with-files\". The description says it's for implementing\n",
      "    Manus-style file-based planning for complex tasks, creating task_plan.md,\n",
      "    findings.md, and progress.md. But the user wants to plan a web search, which\n",
      "    might involve multiple steps. However, the actual execution of the web\n",
      "    search is under \"web-search\", so maybe the planning part is just about\n",
      "    organizing the steps.  Next, check the \"web-search\" instruction. Using\n",
      "    read_skill_instruction again with skill_name \"web-search\". The description\n",
      "    says it enables agents to perform web searches to gather relevant\n",
      "    information. So this skill will be used to execute the search for Stuttgart\n",
      "    sport news.  The user also wants the results written to a specific file. The\n",
      "    \"write_file\" tool is available, which can handle that part.  But according\n",
      "    to the initial instructions, before executing any task related to the\n",
      "    provided skills, I need to read their instructions carefully. So first, I\n",
      "    should retrieve both skill instructions. Then, if there are reference\n",
      "    materials or examples, use read_skill_reference. If there's a script,\n",
      "    execute it. Otherwise, proceed.  Wait, but the user is asking to perform the\n",
      "    task using \"web-search\" as guidance. So after planning with \"planning-with-\n",
      "    files\", the actual search would be done via web_search. However, the exact\n",
      "    parameters for web_search aren't specified in the tools. The tool's\n",
      "    description doesn't have parameters listed, but looking at the tools\n",
      "    provided, the web_search function isn't detailed here. Wait, the tools\n",
      "    section lists functions like calculate, copy_file, execute_skill_script,\n",
      "    etc., but web_search isn't among them. Wait, no—the tools listed are the\n",
      "    available functions. Let me check again.  Looking at the tools JSON, the\n",
      "    functions include things like calculate, copy_file, execute_skill_script,\n",
      "    get_current_time, list_directory_contents, read_file,\n",
      "    read_skill_instruction, read_skill_reference, unit_convert, write_file.\n",
      "    There's no explicit web_search function listed here. But in the\n",
      "    INSTRUCTIONS, there's a skill called \"web-search\" with a description about\n",
      "    performing web searches. However, the tools provided don't include a\n",
      "    web_search function. This is a problem because the user wants to use \"web-\n",
      "    search\" as guidance, but there's no corresponding tool to actually perform\n",
      "    the search.  Wait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding. The INSTRUCTIONS are skills\n",
      "    that guide how certain tasks should be handled, and the tools are the\n",
      "    functions available. But if the web_search skill exists in the instructions\n",
      "    but isn't present as a tool, then maybe the assistant is supposed to use\n",
      "    another method or there's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the\n",
      "    execute_skill_script function is intended here. Let me re-examine.  The\n",
      "    execute_skill_script tool requires a skill_name, script_link, and\n",
      "    parameters. The user hasn't provided any scripts or links, so unless the\n",
      "    skill instruction for web-search includes a script link, which we don't have\n",
      "    yet. So first, I need to read the skill instruction for \"web-search\" using\n",
      "    read_skill_instruction. Let's proceed.  So first step: call\n",
      "    read_skill_instruction for \"planning-with-files\" and \"web-search\".  But\n",
      "    since the user mentioned both skills as guidance, perhaps the planning part\n",
      "    is handled by planning-with-files, which might generate a plan involving\n",
      "    web_search. However, without knowing the exact script or parameters, it's\n",
      "    unclear. Since the tools don't include a direct web search function except\n",
      "    possibly through execute_skill_script.  Wait, but looking back at the tools\n",
      "    list again: the available functions are calculate, copy_file,\n",
      "    execute_skill_script, get_current_time, list_directory_contents, read_file,\n",
      "    read_skill_instruction, read_skill_reference, unit_convert, write_file.\n",
      "    There's no tool named \"web_search\" or similar. Therefore, the only way to\n",
      "    perform a web search as per the instructions is if the skill instruction for\n",
      "    \"web-search\" provides a script that can be executed via\n",
      "    execute_skill_script.  Therefore, the steps would be:  1. Use\n",
      "    read_skill_instruction on \"planning-with-files\" and \"web-search\" to get\n",
      "    their details. 2. Check if these skills have associated scripts or\n",
      "    references that need to be read. 3. Then, use execute_skill_script for\n",
      "    web_search with appropriate parameters to perform the search. 4. After\n",
      "    obtaining the results, write them to the specified file using write_file.\n",
      "    But since I don't have access to the actual content of the skill\n",
      "    instructions (since this is a simulated scenario), I need to proceed based\n",
      "    on the given descriptions.  The \"planning-with-files\" skill says it creates\n",
      "    task_plan.md, findings.md, and progress.md when starting complex tasks.\n",
      "    However, the user wants to plan a web search, which might be considered a\n",
      "    complex task requiring multiple steps. But the actual execution is via\n",
      "    web_search. Maybe the planning step here is just about organizing the\n",
      "    process, but since the user directly asks to perform the web search using\n",
      "    that guidance, perhaps the main action is the web_search.  But without a\n",
      "    direct tool for web_search, the assistant must rely on execute_skill_script.\n",
      "    Therefore, after reading the skill instruction for \"web-search\", if it\n",
      "    contains a script link, then use execute_skill_script with that link and\n",
      "    parameters like the query (\"sport news from Stuttgart current month\").\n",
      "    Assuming that the read_skill_instruction for \"web-search\" returns an\n",
      "    instruction that includes a script link, the next step would be to call\n",
      "    execute_skill_script with skill_name \"web-search\", the script_link obtained,\n",
      "    and parameters specifying the search query.  Once the web search is executed\n",
      "    and results are obtained (at least 5 news items), then use write_file to\n",
      "    create \"stuttgart_sport_news.md\" with the content.  But since this is a\n",
      "    simulated environment and I don't have actual access to the script links or\n",
      "    parameters, I need to structure the tool calls accordingly based on the\n",
      "    given information.  So, putting it all together:  First, read the skill\n",
      "    instructions for both \"planning-with-files\" and \"web-search\".  Then, if\n",
      "    needed, read any references. But since the user hasn't provided reference\n",
      "    links yet, perhaps proceed to execute the script.  But according to the\n",
      "    initial instructions, before executing any task related to the skills, first\n",
      "    read their instructions. So first tool calls are to read_skill_instruction\n",
      "    for both skills.  Wait, but the user's query says \"Using 'planning-with-\n",
      "    files' as guidance to plan a web search... After that, perform the task\n",
      "    using 'web-search' as guidance.\" So the planning part is handled by\n",
      "    planning-with-files, then execution by web_search. However, without knowing\n",
      "    how exactly these skills are implemented via the tools, perhaps the\n",
      "    assistant needs to first invoke planning-with-files (maybe generating some\n",
      "    plan files), then use web_search.  But given the tools available, here's a\n",
      "    possible approach:  1. Use read_skill_instruction on \"planning-with-files\"\n",
      "    to understand its requirements. Suppose the instruction says that when\n",
      "    starting complex tasks, it creates task_plan.md, etc. But since the user\n",
      "    wants to plan a web search, maybe this step is just about initiating the\n",
      "    process.  2. Then, use read_skill_instruction on \"web-search\" to get its\n",
      "    details. Assume the instruction mentions using execute_skill_script with a\n",
      "    certain script link and parameters.  3. Call execute_skill_script for \"web-\n",
      "    search\" with the obtained script_link and parameters like {\"query\": \"sport\n",
      "    news Stuttgart current month\"}.  4. Once the search results are obtained\n",
      "    (simulated here as 5 news items), use write_file to save them into\n",
      "    \"stuttgart_sport_news.md\".  However, since in this scenario I'm simulating\n",
      "    the tool calls without actual execution, I need to structure each step\n",
      "    properly.  But according to the problem setup, the assistant should generate\n",
      "    the appropriate tool calls based on the instructions and available tools.\n",
      "    Let's proceed step by step.\u001b[0m\n",

      "    The user wants to use the \"planning-with-files\" guidance to plan a web\n",
      "    search for sport news from Stuttgart of the current month and return at\n",
      "    least 5 news items. Then, they want the results written to a file called\n",
      "    \"stuttgart_sport_news.md\".   First, I need to recall the instructions\n",
      "    provided earlier. The user mentioned using the XML tags with various skills,\n",
      "    including \"planning-with-files\" and \"web-search\". From the previous tool\n",
      "    call response for \"planning-with-files\", there's a detailed guide on how to\n",
      "    structure planning files like task_plan.md, findings.md, and progress.md.\n",
      "    The user's task involves multiple steps: planning with files, performing a\n",
      "    web search, and writing results to a file. According to the planning-with-\n",
      "    files instructions, I should start by creating the necessary planning files\n",
      "    in the project directory. The templates are available in the skill\n",
      "    directory, but the actual files need to be created in the current working\n",
      "    directory.  Next, since the task requires using \"web-search\" as guidance, I\n",
      "    need to check if there's a specific instruction for web search. However,\n",
      "    looking back at the provided INSTRUCTIONS XML tags, the \"web-search\" skill's\n",
      "    description is brief and doesn't include detailed steps beyond enabling\n",
      "    agents to perform web searches. Therefore, I might not have additional\n",
      "    instructions beyond the general planning framework.  The critical rules from\n",
      "    planning-with-files emphasize creating the plan first. So, before executing\n",
      "    any tool calls, I should generate the task_plan.md. This file outlines the\n",
      "    phases of the project. The user's task has two main phases: planning the web\n",
      "    search and then performing it to gather news. Each phase should be detailed\n",
      "    in the plan.  After setting up the plan, the next step is to execute the web\n",
      "    search using the \"web-search\" tool. But wait, how does the web_search\n",
      "    function work? The tools list includes a \"web_search\" function, but its\n",
      "    parameters aren't specified here. Typically, a web search tool would require\n",
      "    a query parameter. Since the user wants sport news from Stuttgart for the\n",
      "    current month, the query should reflect that. However, without knowing the\n",
      "    exact parameters of the web_search function, I have to assume it takes a\n",
      "    'query' string.  Once the web search is performed, the results need to be\n",
      "    written to \"stuttgart_sport_news.md\". The write_file tool will handle this,\n",
      "    requiring the file path, content, and mode. Since the user didn't specify\n",
      "    appending or overwriting, defaulting to overwrite makes sense unless there's\n",
      "    existing content, but that's probably not the case here.  But before\n",
      "    proceeding, according to the planning-with-files instructions, after every\n",
      "    two view/browser/search operations, I must save key findings to text files.\n",
      "    The web search counts as a search operation, so immediately after getting\n",
      "    the results, writing them to findings.md or directly to the target file is\n",
      "    necessary.  Wait, the user wants the final output in\n",
      "    \"stuttgart_sport_news.md\", which isn't one of the standard planning files.\n",
      "    However, the planning-with-files skill allows for creating other files as\n",
      "    needed. The instruction says that any artifacts created should follow the\n",
      "    theme-factory if styling is involved, but here it's just a markdown file.\n",
      "    Putting this all together:  1. Create task_plan.md in the project directory\n",
      "    using the template as a reference. This outlines the phases: planning the\n",
      "    search and executing it. 2. Update findings.md with the web search results\n",
      "    after performing the search. 3. Use web_search with the appropriate query to\n",
      "    fetch the sport news from Stuttgart for the current month, ensuring at least\n",
      "    5 articles. 4. Write the collected news into \"stuttgart_sport_news.md\" using\n",
      "    write_file.  But I need to check if there are any constraints or references\n",
      "    I must follow. The user mentioned using \"planning-with-files\" as guidance\n",
      "    and then \"web-search\" as guidance. Since the web_search skill's instruction\n",
      "    is minimal, I'll proceed with standard practices unless there's a specific\n",
      "    script or reference to execute.  Another consideration: the planning-with-\n",
      "    files requires creating task_plan, findings, and progress files first. So\n",
      "    before even calling web_search, I should initialize these files. The user\n",
      "    might expect that the planning process is followed meticulously, including\n",
      "    updating the plan after each phase.  Therefore, the steps would be:  - Call\n",
      "    read_skill_instruction for \"planning-with-files\" to get details (already\n",
      "    done in the previous interaction). - Create task_plan.md, findings.md, and\n",
      "    progress.md in the project directory. - In task_plan.md, outline the phases:\n",
      "    planning the web search and executing it to gather news. - Proceed to\n",
      "    execute the web_search tool with the query for Stuttgart sport news of the\n",
      "    current month. - After obtaining the results, update findings.md with the\n",
      "    gathered information. - Then, write the final results to\n",
      "    \"stuttgart_sport_news.md\" using write_file.  But wait, the user's\n",
      "    instruction says to perform the task using \"web-search\" as guidance. Since\n",
      "    the web_search skill doesn't have detailed instructions beyond its\n",
      "    description, perhaps there's no additional step needed beyond using the tool\n",
      "    normally. However, if there were a script or reference for web_search, I\n",
      "    would need to use read_skill_reference or execute_skill_script. But given\n",
      "    the provided INSTRUCTIONS XML, the web_search entry doesn't include such\n",
      "    details, so those tools aren't necessary here.  Now, considering the actual\n",
      "    execution:  First, create the planning files. The user's current working\n",
      "    directory is where these files should reside. Using copy_file or write_file\n",
      "    to create them based on templates. However, the templates are in the skill\n",
      "    directory 'templates', but the user's project directory is separate. The\n",
      "    assistant needs to copy or reference those templates.  But the tools\n",
      "    available include list_directory_contents, read_file, write_file, etc. So\n",
      "    steps would involve:  1. Check if the project directory exists and contains\n",
      "    the necessary files. If not, create them. 2. Use the templates from the\n",
      "    skill directory (assuming access) to populate task_plan.md, findings.md,\n",
      "    progress.md in the project directory.  However, without knowing the exact\n",
      "    paths or having access to the templates' content via tools, this might be a\n",
      "    hurdle. The assistant might need to generate these files based on the\n",
      "    template descriptions provided in the planning-with-files instruction.\n",
      "    Alternatively, since the user has already read the skill instruction and the\n",
      "    response included template references like\n",
      "    [templates/task_plan.md](templates/task_plan.md), but those are links within\n",
      "    the documentation. In practice, the assistant would need to use tools like\n",
      "    read_file to access those templates if they exist locally. But given the\n",
      "    tool constraints, perhaps the assistant is expected to create these files\n",
      "    programmatically based on the template structure described.  But this could\n",
      "    get complicated. Maybe the key point here is that the planning-with-files\n",
      "    skill requires initializing these files before proceeding. So the first\n",
      "    action after understanding the instructions is to set up task_plan.md,\n",
      "    findings.md, and progress.md.  Once those are in place, the next step is the\n",
      "    web search. The query for Stuttgart sport news of the current month would be\n",
      "    constructed. Using get_current_time to determine the month, but perhaps the\n",
      "    web_search can handle relative dates in the query.  After obtaining the\n",
      "    search results, the assistant must save them according to the 2-Action Rule:\n",
      "    after every two view/browser/search operations, immediately save key\n",
      "    findings. Since this is a single search operation, saving the findings right\n",
      "    away makes sense.  Finally, writing the results to \"stuttgart_sport_news.md\"\n",
      "    would involve compiling at least five news items and using write_file to\n",
